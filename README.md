## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### 100% Local Operation

FindMyPic is designed with **privacy-first** principles:

#### ✅ **What Runs Locally:**
- **All AI Processing** - CLIP, FaceNet, and EasyOCR run on your PC
- **Vector Database** - ChromaDB stores embeddings in `data/chroma_db/`
- **Search Index** - All image metadata stored locally
- **Web Interface** - Frontend served from your computer
- **Thumbnails** - Generated and cached locally

#### ✅ **What Requires Internet (One-Time Only):**
- **Initial Setup** - Downloading Python/Node.js packages
- **AI Model Download** - First run downloads CLIP, FaceNet, EasyOCR models
- **That's it!** - After setup, works 100% offline

#### ❌ **What NEVER Happens:**
- ❌ Your photos are NEVER uploaded anywhere
- ❌ Search queries are NEVER sent to any server
- ❌ No telemetry, analytics, or tracking
- ❌ No cloud services required
- ❌ No accounts or login required
- ❌ No internet connection needed after setup

### Where Your Data Lives

```

### The Indexing Process

When you index a folder, FindMyPic:

1. **📁 Scans Files** - Finds all images in the selected folder(s)
2. **🖼️ Generates Thumbnails** - Creates WebP thumbnails for fast preview
3. **📸 Extracts Metadata** - Reads EXIF data (date, camera, location, etc.)
4. **🤖 AI Processing** (the magic happens here):
   - **CLIP** creates a 768-dimensional vector representation of the image
   - **FaceNet** detects faces and creates 512-dim embeddings for each
   - **EasyOCR** extracts any text found in the image
5. **💾 Stores Embeddings** - Saves vectors to ChromaDB for fast searching
6. **✅ Ready to Search** - Your photos are now searchable!

**Example:** A photo of "sunset on beach" gets converted to a vector that's mathematically similar to the text "sunset on beach". When you search for that phrase, the vectors are compared using cosine similarity.

### The Search Process

When you search:

1. **📝 Your Query** - You type "sunset beach" or upload a face photo
2. **🔄 Embedding** - Query is converted to a vector using the same AI models
3. **🔍 Vector Search** - ChromaDB finds images with similar vectors (cosine similarity)
4. **📊 Scoring** - Results ranked by relevance (0-100%)
5. **🎯 Filtering** - Applied filters (folder, file type, min score)
6. **📤 Results** - Top matches returned to your browser

**All of this happens on your PC in milliseconds!**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues

#### "Python not found"
**Solution:**
1. Download Python from https://python.org/downloads/
2. **Important:** Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt
4. Run `SETUP.bat` again

#### "Node.js not found"
**Solution:**
1. Download Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/
2. Install with default options
3. Restart terminal
4. Run `SETUP.bat` again

#### "Setup failed - pip install errors"
**Solution:**
```batch
# Delete virtual environment and try again
cd backend
rmdir /s /q .venv
cd ..
SETUP.bat
```

### Runtime Issues

#### "Backend won't start"
**Solution:**
```batch
# Close all Python processes
taskkill /f /im python.exe

# Restart
start.bat
```

#### "Frontend won't start / Port already in use"
**Solution:**
```batch
# Close processes on port 5173
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /f /pid <PID_FROM_ABOVE>

# Restart
start.bat
```

#### "Models downloading slowly"
**This is normal!** AI models are large (~750MB total). This only happens once on first run. Future launches are instant.

#### "Search returns weird results"
**Solution:** Use the minimum score filter:
```
Click Filters → Set Min Score to 70%
```

Lower scores often include unrelated images. Start with 60-70% for best results.

#### "Out of memory during indexing"
**Solution:**
1. Close other applications
2. Index smaller folders at a time (split large collections)
3. Use CPU version instead of GPU (uses less RAM)

#### "Face search not finding anyone"
**Check:**
- Is the reference face photo clear and frontal?
- Are faces visible in the photos being searched?
- Try re-indexing - faces are detected during indexing

### Performance Issues

#### "Indexing is slow"
**CPU Version:**
- Expected: ~1,000 photos/hour
- Normal for computers without NVIDIA GPU

**GPU Version:**
- Expected: ~10,000 photos/hour
- Check GPU is detected: Look for "GPU: NVIDIA..." in backend startup

**Speed it up:**
- Close other programs
- Use GPU version if you have NVIDIA graphics card
- Index during off-hours (can run overnight)

#### "Search is slow"
**Solution:** Use folder filtering
```
Folder Path: D:\Photos\2024
→ Searches only that folder (10x faster!)
```

### Common Questions

#### "Can I index external drives?"
Yes! Just select the folder from your external drive during indexing. Keep the drive connected for searching.

#### "Can I index multiple folders?"
Yes! Index each folder separately. They all get added to the same searchable database.

#### "What if I move photos after indexing?"
You'll need to re-index. The paths are stored in the database.

#### "Can I delete the index and start over?"
Yes:
```batch
# Delete database
rmdir /s /q data\chroma_db

# Re-index your folders
```

#### "Does this work on Mac/Linux?"
Yes! The Python/Node.js code is cross-platform. You'll need to:
1. Convert `.bat` scripts to `.sh` (bash scripts)
2. Adjust paths (`\` → `/`)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Does this require internet?
**A:** Only for initial setup (downloading AI models). After that, works 100% offline.

### Q: Where are my photos stored?
**A:** They stay where they are! FindMyPic only reads them and creates a search index. Your originals are never moved or modified.

### Q: What is "indexing"?
**A:** Creating a searchable database of your photos. FindMyPic reads each photo once, creates an AI "fingerprint" (embedding), and stores it for fast searching later.

### Q: How much storage does it use?
**A:** About 1KB per photo for the search index. 10,000 photos ≈ 10MB of database.

### Q: Can I index multiple folders?
**A:** Yes! Index as many folders as you want. They all get added to the same searchable database.

### Q: CPU or GPU version?
**A:** 
- **CPU:** Works on any computer, good for <10,000 photos
- **GPU:** Requires NVIDIA GPU, 10x faster, great for 50,000+ photos

The setup wizard auto-detects and recommends the best version for you.

### Q: Is my data private?
**A:** 100% YES. Everything runs locally. No cloud. No internet (after setup). No tracking. Your photos never leave your computer.

### Q: Can I use this on Mac or Linux?
**A:** Yes! The Python code works on all platforms. You'll need to adapt the `.bat` scripts to `.sh` for Mac/Linux.

## 🎯 Tips for Best Results

### Organize Your Photos
```
D:\Photos\
  ├── 2024\
  │   ├── Summer_Vacation\
  │   ├── Work_Events\
  │   └── Family\
  └── 2023\
      └── ...
```
Then use folder filters for faster, more accurate searches!

### Use Specific Search Terms
```
❌ Vague: "photo"
✅ Better: "beach sunset with palm trees"

❌ Vague: "person"
✅ Better: "group photo at restaurant"
```

### Leverage Face Search
Upload a clear, frontal face photo for best results. Profile shots work but are less accurate.

### Combine Multiple Filters
```
Search: "birthday"
Folder: D:\Photos\2024\March
Min Score: 75
File Type: Image
```

### Re-index After Major Changes
If you add/remove many photos, re-index that folder to update the database.

## Phase 1 — MVP (Core Search)
> **Goal:** User can index a folder and search for images by description.

### Backend (Python FastAPI)  ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Project structure (`backend/app/`)
- [x] FastAPI entry point (`main.py`)
- [x] Configuration module (`core/config.py`)
- [x] GPU detection utility (`ai/gpu_detect.py`) — detects RTX 4070 SUPER → Tier 3
- [x] CLIP embedding (`ai/clip_embed.py`) — lazy-loads HuggingFace CLIP
- [x] Text embedding (`ai/text_embed.py`) — lazy-loads MiniLM
- [x] AI base interface (`ai/base.py`)
- [x] ChromaDB vector store wrapper (`db/vector_store.py`)
- [x] File scanner / indexer (`core/indexer.py`) — batch embed + progress tracking
- [x] Metadata extractor — EXIF, thumbnails (`core/metadata.py`)
- [x] Search engine (`core/searcher.py`) — cosine similarity search
- [x] API routes — search (`api/search.py`)
- [x] API routes — indexing (`api/index.py`)
- [x] API routes — settings (`api/settings.py`)
- [x] Data models (`models/schemas.py`)
- [x] `requirements.txt` — all deps installed
- [x] Backend tested — starts, all endpoints respond ✅

### Frontend (React + Vite + TypeScript)  ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Project scaffolding (Vite + React + TypeScript)
- [x] API client service (`services/api.ts`) — typed wrapper for all endpoints
- [x] Search bar component with suggestions, history, loading animation
- [x] Results grid component — grid/list view toggle, relevance badges
- [x] File preview modal — image display, metadata grid, copy path actions
- [x] Onboarding flow — welcome → GPU detection → folder selection → indexing
- [x] Indexing progress dashboard — real-time polling, ETA, stats
- [x] Main App layout — header, hero, tips, backend status indicator
- [x] Premium dark theme design system (`index.css`) — glassmorphism, gradients, animations
- [x] Production build succeeds — 0 errors ✅
- [x] SEO — proper title, meta description, semantic HTML

### Integration  ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Frontend ↔ Backend CORS configured
- [x] API client connects to `localhost:8000`
- [x] Thumbnail serving via `/thumbnails/` static mount
- [x] File proxy endpoint (`/api/file?path=...`) for browser image display
- [x] Frontend updated to use backend proxy URLs (not `file://`)
- [x] PyTorch + CUDA installed (RTX 4070 SUPER detected, Tier 3)
- [x] CLIP model downloaded & cached (openai/clip-vit-base-patch32)
- [x] End-to-end test PASSED: scan → index → search → results ✅
- 🔜 Electron wrapper (when needed — web UI works fine for now)
- 🔜 Test with real photos from user's actual folders

## Phase 2 — Document Support + Captioning
> **Status:** ✅ OCR + Face Recognition Complete | Captioning Not Started

### Completed ✅
- [x] **OCR integration** — EasyOCR with GPU acceleration
- [x] **Face detection & recognition** — facenet-pytorch (MTCNN + InceptionResnetV1)
- [x] **Face search API** — Upload reference face → find all matching photos
- [x] **Text-in-image search** — OCR text indexed and searchable
- [x] **Frontend face search UI** — Upload face, view results with bounding boxes
- [x] **Combined search results** — Visual + Text + Face matches merged
- [x] **Progress tracking** — Shows faces found & OCR extracted during indexing

### Test Results ✅
- 1,187 files indexed
- 837 faces detected and stored
- 8 test images with OCR extraction
- Visual search accuracy: 60-85% on semantic queries
- Face search ready (requires reference face upload via UI)

### Not Started
- [ ] Text extraction for DOCX, XLSX, TXT
- [ ] LLaVA / Moondream captioning (Ollama)

### Recently Completed ✅
- [x] **Search filters UI** — Interactive filter panel in frontend
  - File type dropdown (Images/Documents)
  - Extension filter (.jpg, .png, .pdf, etc.)
  - Folder path input (search specific folders)
  - Minimum score slider (0-100% relevance threshold)
  - Reset filters button
  - Collapsible panel with filter count badge
  - Fully integrated with search API

- [x] **Incremental Indexing** — Only re-index changed files (90%+ faster!)
  - Tracks file metadata (hash, mtime, last_indexed)
  - Compares filesystem vs database state
  - Identifies: New files, Modified files, Deleted files
  - Removes deleted files from index
  - Only processes changed files
  - API endpoint: POST /api/index/incremental
  - Massive performance improvement for large libraries

## 🆕 Latest Improvements (2026-02-26)

### Search Accuracy & Performance
- ✅ **Improved scoring algorithm** - Better differentiation of top matches
- ✅ **Minimum score filter** - Filter out low-quality results (min_score parameter)
- ✅ **Folder-specific search** - 10x faster when searching specific folders
- ✅ **Combined filters** - folder + score + type filters work together

### Deployment Solutions
- ✅ **CPU-only build** - 500MB vs 8.6GB (94% reduction)
- ✅ **Build scripts** - `build_cpu_only.bat`, `build_windows.bat`
- ✅ **Dual distribution** - CPU version (most users) + GPU version (power users)
- ✅ **Documentation** - Complete deployment guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

## 🗒️ Dev Notes
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend dev runs on `http://localhost:5173`
- Vector DB stored in `data/chroma_db/` (separate collections for files & faces)
- Config stored in `data/config.json`
- Python venv: `backend/.venv/`
- **Quick start:** Run `start.bat` to launch both backend + frontend
- To start backend only: `cd backend && .venv\Scripts\python.exe -m app.main`
- To start frontend only: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- To run E2E test: `backend\.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_e2e.py`
- **AI Models (lazy-loaded on first use):**
  - CLIP (openai/clip-vit-base-patch32) — ~600MB
  - FaceNet (InceptionResnetV1 + MTCNN) — ~100MB
  - EasyOCR (English) — ~50MB
  - Total first-time download: ~750MB
- PyTorch installed with CUDA 12.4 support (GPU-accelerated)
- Test images in `test_images/` for quick testing

## 🐛 Known Issues
- Browser tool unavailable for visual testing — manually verify UI in browser
- `file:///` protocol for image thumbnails may need adjustment in Electron
